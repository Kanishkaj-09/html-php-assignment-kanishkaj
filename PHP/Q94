Evaluate the different file handling modes available in PHP with appropriate examples.

PHPâ€™s fopen() function requires a mode argument. Common file modes:

Mode	     Description	                                                          Example
"r"	       Open for read only; pointer at beginning	                              $f = fopen("data.txt", "r");
"r+"	     Open for read & write; pointer at beginning	                          $f = fopen("data.txt", "r+");
"w"      	 Open for write only; truncate file to 0 length or create new	          $f = fopen("data.txt", "w");
"w+"	     Open for read & write; truncate file or create new	                    $f = fopen("data.txt", "w+");
"a"	       Open for write only; append at end; create new if not exists	          $f = fopen("data.txt", "a");
"a+"	     Open for read & write; pointer at end; create new if not exists	      $f = fopen("data.txt", "a+");
"x"      	 Create & open for write only; error if file exists	                    $f = fopen("new.txt", "x");
"x+"	     Create & open for read & write; error if file exists	                  $f = fopen("new.txt", "x+");

Example:
Writing and reading with w+
<?php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "w+");
fwrite($file, "Hello PHP File Handling!");
rewind($file); // Move pointer back to beginning
echo fread($file, filesize("example.txt"));
fclose($file);
?>
