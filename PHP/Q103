Create a very simple pageview counter by using ‘isset’ to check if the pageview variable has
already been created.

SOLUTION:
EXPLANATION:
session_start() → Starts or resumes the session.
isset($_SESSION['views']) → Checks if the counter already exists.
If yes → increments by 1.
If not → initializes it to 1.
Displays how many times the page has been visited during the session.

CODE:
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();

// Check if 'views' session variable is already created
if (isset($_SESSION['views'])) {
    $_SESSION['views']++;  // Increment counter
} else {
    $_SESSION['views'] = 1; // First visit
}

// Display the number of views
echo "You have visited this page " . $_SESSION['views'] . " times.";
?>

OUTPUT:
You have visited this page 1 times.
