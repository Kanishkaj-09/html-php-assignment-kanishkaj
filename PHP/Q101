Identify, how a cookieâ€™s value can be retrieved in a web application?

SOLUTION:
Retrieving a Cookie Value:
1. To set a cookie, we use setcookie().
2. To retrieve a cookie, we use $_COOKIE['cookie_name'].

CODE:
<?php
// Set a cookie (valid for 1 hour)
setcookie("username", "Kanishka", time() + 3600, "/");

// Retrieve cookie value
if (isset($_COOKIE["username"])) {
    echo "Cookie Value: " . $_COOKIE["username"];
} else {
    echo "Cookie is not set yet!";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
Cookie is not set yet!

Key Points:
1. setcookie() must be called before any HTML output.
2. Cookies are stored on the client (browser) and sent back with every request.
3. To check if a cookie exists, always use isset($_COOKIE['name']).
4. Cookie values are available on subsequent page loads (not immediately after setting).
