PHP File functions with example program.

SOLUTION:
Function	                Purpose
fopen()	                  Opens a file (for reading/writing).
fread()	                  Reads data from an open file.
fwrite()	                Writes data to an open file.
fclose()	                Closes an open file.
file_get_contents()	      Reads the entire file into a string.
file_put_contents()	      Writes/overwrites data into a file.
unlink()	                Deletes a file.
feof()	                  Checks if end-of-file is reached.
filesize()	              Returns the size of a file in bytes.

CODE:
<?php
$filename = "demo.txt";

// 1. Write content into file using fopen() and fwrite()
$file = fopen($filename, "w"); // open in write mode
fwrite($file, "Hello, this is a file handling example.\n");
fwrite($file, "PHP makes file handling easy!");
fclose($file);
echo "Data written successfully.<br>";

// 2. Read content using fopen() and fread()
$file = fopen($filename, "r");
$content = fread($file, filesize($filename));
fclose($file);
echo "<b>File Content:</b><br>" . nl2br($content) . "<br><br>";

// 3. Append content using file_put_contents()
file_put_contents($filename, "\nThis line is appended.", FILE_APPEND);
echo "Data appended successfully.<br>";

// 4. Read file again using file_get_contents()
$content = file_get_contents($filename);
echo "<b>Updated File Content:</b><br>" . nl2br($content) . "<br><br>";

// 5. Delete file using unlink()
if (unlink($filename)) {
    echo "File '$filename' deleted successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Error deleting file.";
}
?>

OUTPUT FLOW:
1. Creates a file demo.txt.
2. Writes text into it.
3. Reads and displays contents.
4. Appends more text.
5. Displays updated file contents.
6. Deletes the file.
