Write a PHP program that keeps track of how many times a visitor has loaded the page.

CODE:
<?php
session_start();
if (isset($_SESSION['count'])) {
    $_SESSION['count']++;
} else {
    $_SESSION['count'] = 1;
}
echo "You have visited this page " . $_SESSION['count'] . " times.";
?>

OUTPUT:
You have visited this page 1 times.
