Recognize how sessions are stored in PHP?

SOLUTION:
Sessions in PHP are stored on the server (not in the browser).
By default, PHP stores session data in temporary files on the server.
Each session is identified by a unique session ID (usually stored in a cookie named PHPSESSID on the clientâ€™s browser).
When the user makes a request:
Browser sends the session ID (via cookie or URL).
PHP finds the corresponding session file (e.g., in /tmp on Linux or C:\xampp\tmp on Windows).
Session data ($_SESSION) is loaded from that file.
When the script ends, changes to $_SESSION are written back to the session file.
