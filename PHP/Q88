Generate a simple PHP 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days
between current day and birthday.

CODE:
<?php
// Set your birthday (month-day format)
$birthday = "09-25";  // Example: 25th September

// Current date
$today = date("Y-m-d");
$currentYear = date("Y");

// Birthday date for current year
$birthdayThisYear = date("Y-m-d", strtotime($currentYear . "-" . $birthday));

// If birthday already passed this year, use next year
if ($birthdayThisYear < $today) {
    $birthdayThisYear = date("Y-m-d", strtotime(($currentYear + 1) . "-" . $birthday));
}

// Calculate difference in days
$diff = (strtotime($birthdayThisYear) - strtotime($today)) / (60 * 60 * 24);

echo "<h2>Birthday Countdown</h2>";
echo "Your next birthday is on: " . date("l, d F Y", strtotime($birthdayThisYear)) . "<br>";
echo "Days left until your birthday: <b>" . $diff . " days</b>";
?>

OUTPUT:
Birthday Countdown
Your next birthday is on: Thursday, 25 September 2025
Days left until your birthday: 39 days
